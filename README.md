# Juilcal | Juilliard Calendar Searcher/Scraper

This project is a result of my desire for a convenient way to find events to attend on Juilliard's 
performance calendar. I found Juilliard's own performance calendar page lacking in terms of what it let users
search for with their limited drop-down menu.

Results are scraped every ~20 minutes from [Juilliard's page](https://www.juilliard.edu/stage-beyond/performance/calendar) to ensure that results are accurate.
