# Juilcal | Keyword Search 

www.juilcal.com

Juilliard's own performance calendar lacks a simple and easy keyword search. 
I wrote a web scraper to save and parse all events on the calendar using Requests and 
Beautiful Soup in Python. Users of Juilcal are able to search through the calendar using
multiple keywords. The app is built with Flask and Jinja.

All events are archived and moved to /dbtrash once per day.
